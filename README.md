# telegram-bot
My first telegram bot
This is part of the telegram bot for the nail studio in Odessa, in which I implemented the following functions, lay a route from the user's current location to the studio via the Google Map, receive studio contacts and click on the links.

The next step will be to create a database of studio clients and the ability to record clients on procedures from a telegram directly to google calendar.

Below you can see an example of how this bot works.
